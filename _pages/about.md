I am a senior undergraduate major in Information Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io/) on **Multi-Agent Intelligence**, specifically **Collaborative Perception**. I also worked on recommendation system with [Prof. Xiaofeng Gao](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/).

I spent the summer this year at the [IDEAS Lab](https://ideas.cs.purdue.edu/), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), working on the topics of **Collaborative Multi-Agent System**, tutored by [Prof. Aniket Bera](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/) and [Dr. Kshitij Tiwari](https://kshitijtiwari.com/).
