Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Purdue ECE, co-advised by Prof. Yaobin Chen and [Prof. Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/).

I received my bachelor degree in information engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io). I have also spent a wonderful summer at the [Department of Computer Science, Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) as a research intern, advised by [Prof. Aniket Bera](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/).

My research focuses on autonomous driving and computer vision, specifically on end-to-end driving and human-AI teaming. Previously, I worked on the efficiency aspect of collaborative perception and making use of the complementary strengths of agents in heterogeneous systems.
