I am a senior undergraduate major in **Information Engineering** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io/) on **multi-agent intelligence**, specifically **collaborative perception**. I also worked on recommendation system with [Prof. Xiaofeng Gao](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/).

I'm currently a student intern at the [IDEAS Lab](https://ideas.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), working on the topics of **multi-agent robotic system** under the guidance of [Prof. Aniket Bera](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ab/) and [Dr. Kshitij Tiwari](https://kshitijtiwari.com/).
