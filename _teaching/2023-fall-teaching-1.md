This course introduces students to the basic principles, methods and tools in the field of data science. I help prepare example codes and materials to demonstrate techniques during lectures, especially on topics like artificial intelligence. Students will have the opportunity to work through examples applying what they learn. I also assist students with any questions about concepts, methods or codes from class. My aim is to help students understand and apply data science approaches through hands-on examples and support.
