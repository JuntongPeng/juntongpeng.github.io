**Abstract:** We introduce a new approach to address the task allocation problem in a system of **heterogeneous robots** comprising of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed model, GATAR, or Graph Attention Task AllocatoR aggregates information from neighbors in the multi-robot system, with the aim of achieving joint optimality in the target localization efficiency.Being decentralized, our method is highly robust and adaptable to situations where collaborators may change over time, ensuring the continuity of the mission. We also proposed heterogeneity-aware preprocessing to let all the different types of robots collaborate with a uniform model.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach in a range of simulated scenarios. The model can allocate targets' positions close to the expert algorithm's result, with a median spatial gap less than a unit length. This approach can be used in **multi-robot systems** deployed in **search and rescue missions, environmental monitoring, and disaster response**.
